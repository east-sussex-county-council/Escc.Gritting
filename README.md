# Escc.Gritting

A library for working with data about road gritting.

The `SqlServer` folder contains a schema and repository code for storing data on gritters and their current positions. This is used by [Escc.Gritting.GrittingMap](https://github.com/east-sussex-county-council/Escc.Gritting.GrittingMap) to display gritters on a Google map.
